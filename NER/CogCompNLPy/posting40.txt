Store Leadership

At Sephora, we know our success is based on the fearless leadership of our teams. Each of our retail locations has unique needs to best serve both its clients and staff, and we empower our Leads, Store Directors, Specialists, and District Managers to manage multiple aspects of their businesses as if it was their own.

Your role at Sephora:

As a Specialist, you are a salaried member of the store leadership team. You will directly manage store consultants/advisors to ensure excellent client service, meet sales and productivity goals, and complete HR functions. Reporting to the Store Director, you will act as their "right hand" and will maintain a positive work environment for all employees.

In addition, you will:

  - Act as "Director in Charge." You will set the tone on stage by keeping cast members motivated and handle any client or brand issues efficiently and effectively
  - Monitor daily, weekly, and monthly sales results with store leadership team and communicate to staff as appropriate
  - Maintain objective and professional relationships with brand partners, key stakeholders, peers, direct reports, and supervisors
  - Supervise and train consultants/advisors to develop their client service skills, product knowledge, and tailored career plans
  - Recruit, interview, and hire employees based on store needs and hiring plans
  - Conduct staff-wide training classes as necessary
  - Demonstrate our Sephora values of Passion for Client Service, Innovation, Expertise, Work-Life Balance, Respect for All, Teamwork, & Initiative

We think you'd be a great for this role if you have:

  - 2-5 years' retail management or service industry experience in a fast-pace, high-volume store environment (years of experience required is dependent on store volume)
  - Flexible availability to work during "peak" retail hours such as nights, overnights, weekends, and holidays
  - Demonstrated passion for leading teams, developing others, and delivering an excellent client experience to every customer entering your store
  - Excellent communication skills and retail business acumen

You'll love working here because:

  - The people. You will be surrounded by some of the most talented, supportive, smart, and kind leaders and teams - people you can be proud to work with
  - The product. Employees enjoy a product discount and receive free product courtesy of our brand partners, often multiple times a month (Think your friends and family love you now? Just wait until you work at Sephora!)
  - The education. Sephora heavily invests in training for our store leaders - not just product knowledge but building a personalized career plan with you so you can achieve your professional goals
  - The perks. Sephora offers medical benefits, competitive 401k, gift matching, and a 'perks' program that includes various discounts at participating companies (hotels, rental cars, telecommunication, gyms, etc)
  - The LVMH family. Sephora's parent company, LVMH, is one of the largest luxury groups in the world, providing support to over 70 prestige brands such as Louis Vuitton, Celine, Moet Chandon, Marc Jacobs, Dior, and many more

Our legal team wants you to know what's required:

  - Ability to lift and carry up to 50 pounds and bend/stretch to stock shelves
  - Handle and apply cosmetics products to clients, including fragrance
  - Adherence to Sephora's dress code and other policies in the Sephora Employee Handbook
